# voddler plex plugin 

## known issues
* Only AVOD movies (not series) are supported
* You can't choose to resume a movie or not, if a resume point exists, then it will resume
* Sometimes plex can start to transcode movies even though it doesn't need to.
* Seekbar not working, should be fixed with javascript support
