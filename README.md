* Maintained and developed by David RÃ¶hr <david@rohr.se>
* Orignal idea and code by Thomas Rosenqvist <thomas@rosenqvist.org>

Very beta state, some features work, some dont't. Tested on MacOSX and Windows with PMS 0.9.5.x

## Features

    * Playback on "Play" movies, documentaries and series
    * Playback of trailers

    * Browsing all types of movies, documentaries and series
    * Searching for content
    * Browsing Favorites, Playlist and History

    * List settings (Play/Rental/All) 
    * Sorting settings (Alphabetical/Added/Rating/Views) 
    * Option to enable Adult content 
    * Option to enable Movie Background Art 

## Known Issues

* No playback on rental movies, only browsing. (server side issue)
* When changing a setting you could sometimes get an error msg.
* You can't choose to resume a movie or not, if a resume point exists, then it will resume
* Browsing for movies show movies for all platforms, not just web
* Sometimes Plex tries to transcode movies even though it doesn't need to. (probably some wierd PMS bug)
* Seekbar not working, should be fixed with javascript support
* The search disregardes the adultfilter and doesn't allow adult content (server side mabye?)
